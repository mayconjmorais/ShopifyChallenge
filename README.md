## TASK: Build an image repository.

## THIS PROJECT ALLOWS NEW USERS TO REGISTER AND ADD IMAGES IN THE GALLERY.

## TO REGISTER THE USER NEEDS TO INFORM A NAME, EMAIL, PASSWORD, AND CONFIRM PASSWORD.

## AFTER REGISTRATION IT WILL BE ENABLED TO FUNCTION TO ADD A NEW IMAGE IN THE GALLERY, WITH HIDDEN'S OPTION IF IT IS NECESSARY.
